# System_calls

We can use JavaScript to make system calls using the Node child_process module. This module allows us to spawn new processes, execute shell commands, and manage child processes. One of the most commonly used functions in this module is <b>child_process.exec()</b>, which runs a command in a shell and buffers the output.

The code in the above Repo executes a System Call that backsup a folder by creating a zip file of it. It is a Command Line Utility that takes Absolute Path of the folder as input by the user.

### Steps to Execute
```
npm install
npm start
```
